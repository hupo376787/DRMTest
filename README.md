# DRMTest

DRM test page:
https://dev-drm.ottuat.com/player/bp/bitmovin_bj3_till_2021_07_04_5pm.html

In UWP, I did see that the drm can play using `MediaElement`(pc & xbox works), while `MediaPlayerElement` can't, with error log I pasted. That happens about the issue I posted.

But after a long time now, I updated my os to 19042.928, both can't play drm now, with no error log.

So I don't if they have relations. But you can test using our src.

What I'm sure is that our drm can play in the test page, but in uwp can't.
